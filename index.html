        <div class="intro_to_centenary_wrap">

            <p class="intro_to_centenary_page">People grazing in metaphysical bookshops may have wondered about the
                mysterious
                volume
                called <em>The Kybalion,</em> written by "Three Initiates"and first issued by the Yogi Publication
                Society
                of Chicago in 1908. The best-known edition is a plain volume bound in blue cloth and stamped with gold,
                in a format like those of other books from the same publisher, including various works on yoga by one
                Swami
                Ramacharaka.<br><br>
                <em>The Kybalion</em> claims to be a brief introduction to a mystical tradiion that has survived from
                antiquity.
                The core of the work is a series of aphorisms which, the authors contend, go back to the "early days"
                and
                were "passed
                on from teacher to student...the exact signification and meaning of the terms having been lost for
                several
                centuries."<br><br>
                The word <em>Kybalion,</em> taken at face value, looks vaguely Greek, but it hasno meaning in that
                language;
                the closest word to it in the standard Greek lexicon, curiously, is <em>kybeia,</em> meaning "dice
                game."
                It is also tempting to connect this word with the Jewish mystical tradition known as the Kabbalah,
                especially
                given that early modern occult texts (such as the seventeenth century English translation of Cornelius
                Agrippas's
                <em>Three Books of Occult Philosophy</em>) sometimes use a Hebrew word for Kabbalists:
                <em><small>mecubalim.</small></em> But the Kabbalah is never mentioned in <em>The Kybalion.</em>
                Rather it presents itself as the essence of the teaching of Hermes Trismegistus ("Thrice-Greatest
                Hermes"),
                a legendary, semidevine figure who is said to have brought learning to Egypt in the remotest past.
                Hermes Trismegistus is often identified with both the Greek god Hermes and the Egyption god
                Thoth.<br><br>
                <em>The Kybalion</em> is organised according to seven basic principles, which, it says, form the basis
                of
                occult philosophy:</p>
