                We take great pleasure in presenting to the attention
                of students and investigators of the Secret Doctrines
                this little work based upon the world‑old Hermetic
                Teachings. There has been so little written upon this subject,
                notwithstanding the countless references to the Teachings
                in the many works upon occultism, that the many earnest
                searchers after the Arcane Truths will doubtless welcome the
                appearance of the present volume.<br><br>
                The purpose of this work is not the enunciation of any special
                philosophy or doctrine, but rather is to give to the students a
                statement of the Truth that will serve to reconcile the many
                bits of occult knowledge that they may have acquired, but
                which are apparently opposed to each other and which often
                serve to discourage and disgust the beginner in the study. Our
                intent is not to erect a new Temple of Knowledge, but rather
                to place in the hands of the student a Master‑Key with which
                he may open the many inner doors in the Temple of Mystery
                through the main portals he has already entered.<br><br>
                There is no portion of the occult teachings possessed by the
                world which have been so closely guarded as the fragments
                of the Hermetic Teachings which have come down to us over
                the tens of centuries which have elapsed since the lifetime
                of its great founder, Hermes Trismegistus, the “scribe of the
                gods,” who dwelt in old Egypt in the days when the present
                race of men was in its infancy. Contemporary with Abraham,
                and, if the legends be true, an instructor of that venerable sage,
                Hermes was, and is, the Great Central Sun of Occultism, whose
                rays have served to illumine the countless teachings which
                have been promulgated since his time. All the fundamental and
                basic teachings embedded in the esoteric teachings of every
                race may be traced back to Hermes. Even the most ancient
                teachings of India undoubtedly have their roots in the original
                Hermetic Teachings.<br><br>
                From the land of the Ganges many advanced occultists
                wandered to the land of Egypt, and sat at the feet of the Master.
                From him they obtained the Master‑Key which explained
                and reconciled their divergent views, and thus the Secret
                Doctrine was firmly established. From other lands also came
                the learned ones, all of whom regarded Hermes as the Master
                of Masters, and his influence was so great that in spite of the
                many wanderings from the path on the part of the centuries
                of teachers in these different lands, there may still be found a
                certain basic resemblance and correspondence which underlies
                the many and often quite divergent theories entertained and
                taught by the occultists of these different lands today. The
                student of Comparative Religions will be able to perceive the
                influence of the Hermetic Teachings in every religion worthy
                of the name, now known to man, whether it be a dead religion
                or one in full vigor in our own times. There is always a certain
                correspondence in spite of the contradictory features, and the
                Hermetic Teachings act as the Great Reconciler.<br><br>
                The lifework of Hermes seems to have been in the direction of
                planting the great Seed‑Truth which has grown and blossomed
                in so many strange forms, rather than to establish a school of
                philosophy which would dominate the world’s thought. But,
                nevertheless, the original truths taught by him have been
                kept intact in their original purity by a few men in each age,
                who, refusing great numbers of half‑developed students and
                followers, followed the Hermetic custom and reserved their
                truth for the few who were ready to comprehend and master
                it. From lip to ear the truth has been handed down among the
                few. There have always been a few Initiates in each generation,
                in the various lands of the earth, who kept alive the sacred
                flame of the Hermetic Teachings, and such have always been
                willing to use their lamps to re‑light the lesser lamps of the
                outside world, when the light of truth grew dim, and clouded
                by reason of neglect, and when the wicks became clogged with
                foreign matter. There were always a few to tend faithfully the
                altar of the Truth, upon which was kept alight the Perpetual
                Lamp of Wisdom. These men devoted their lives to the labor of
                love which the poet has so well stated in his lines:<br>
