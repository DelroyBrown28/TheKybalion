            <p class="intro_to_centenary_page">People grazing in metaphysical bookshops may have wondered about the
                mysterious
                volume
                called <em>The Kybalion,</em> written by "Three Initiates"and first issued by the Yogi Publication
                Society
                of Chicago in 1908. The best-known edition is a plain volume bound in blue cloth and stamped with gold,
                in a format like those of other books from the same publisher, including various works on yoga by one
                Swami
                Ramacharaka.<br><br>
                <em>The Kybalion</em> claims to be a brief introduction to a mystical tradiion that has survived from
                antiquity.
                The core of the work is a series of aphorisms which, the authors contend, go back to the "early days"
                and
                were "passed
                on from teacher to student...the exact signification and meaning of the terms having been lost for
                several
                centuries."<br><br>
                The word <em>Kybalion,</em> taken at face value, looks vaguely Greek, but it hasno meaning in that
                language;
                the closest word to it in the standard Greek lexicon, curiously, is <em>kybeia,</em> meaning "dice
                game."
                It is also tempting to connect this word with the Jewish mystical tradition known as the Kabbalah,
                especially
                given that early modern occult texts (such as the seventeenth century English translation of Cornelius
                Agrippas's
                <em>Three Books of Occult Philosophy</em>) sometimes use a Hebrew word for Kabbalists:
                <em><small>mecubalim.</small></em> But the Kabbalah is never mentioned in <em>The Kybalion.</em>
                Rather it presents itself as the essence of the teaching of Hermes Trismegistus ("Thrice-Greatest
                Hermes"),
                a legendary, semidevine figure who is said to have brought learning to Egypt in the remotest past.
                Hermes Trismegistus is often identified with both the Greek god Hermes and the Egyption god
                Thoth.<br><br>
                <em>The Kybalion</em> is organised according to seven basic principles, which, it says, form the basis
                of
                occult philosophy:</p>

            <p class="intro_to_centenary_page2">
                The origins of this book have mystified many. Scholar Philippe Deslippe argues, convincingly, I believe,
                that it was written by
                <!--tag william walker--> William Walker Atkinson, who operated the
                Yogi Publication Society in Chicago (he is also thought to be "Swami Ramacharaka"). As the first
                principle -"Mentalism"- suggestes, the ideas of the <em>The Kybalion</em> bear some resembelance to
                <!--tag new thought--> New Thought, a movement to which Atkinson was closely connected.
                The Universe, <em>The Kybalion</em> tells us, is contained in "the Mind of <small>THE</small> All":
                "The All creates the universe <small>MENTALLY,</small> in a manner akin to the process whereby Man
                creates Mental Images." This ide is central to practically all New Thought teachings.<br><br>
                Nevertheless, the book does echo more remote past. The term
                <!--tag The All--> "The All," for example,
                resembles the Greek <em>t&ograve; p&acirc;n</em> which also means "the all" and which appears in some
                Hermetic maxims, most famously <em>H&egrave;n t&ograve; p&acirc;n:</em> "All is one."<br><br>
                Given the claims made for it, the most obvious source to examine for the roots of the <em>The
                Kybalion</em> is the
                <!--tag corpus hermeticum--> <em>Corpus Hermeticum</em> or "Hermetic Body" of texts. These were
                composed probably in the early centuries <small>CE</small> and purport to expound the widom of Egypt as
                narrated
                in a series of discourses and dialogues including Hermes and his son
                <!--tag tat--> Tat (a version of "Thoth"). And indeed there intriguing resemblances between these works
                and <em>The Kybalion</em>. The first text in the <em>Corpus Hermeticum,</em> the <!--tag Poimandres--><em>Poimandres</em>
                (probably a Greek adaptation of the Egyptian <em>p-eime-n-re</em>, or, "mind of authority"), tells us that the
                source of the universe was no&ucirc;s-conciousness or Mind much as <em>The Kybalion</em> asserts the principle of
                "Mentalism." Moreover, this devine mind is descriped as "being androgyne and existing as light and life" - which
                parallels the concept of "Gender" as set out in <em>The Kybalion.</em><br><br>
                <em>The Kybalion</em>also speaks of the principle of correspondence.
