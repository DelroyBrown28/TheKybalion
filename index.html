                We take great pleasure in presenting to the attention
                of students and investigators of the Secret Doctrines
                this little work based upon the world‑old Hermetic
                Teachings. There has been so little written upon this subject,
                notwithstanding the countless references to the Teachings
                in the many works upon occultism, that the many earnest
                searchers after the Arcane Truths will doubtless welcome the
                appearance of the present volume.<br><br>
                The purpose of this work is not the enunciation of any special
                philosophy or doctrine, but rather is to give to the students a
                statement of the Truth that will serve to reconcile the many
                bits of occult knowledge that they may have acquired, but
                which are apparently opposed to each other and which often
                serve to discourage and disgust the beginner in the study. Our
                intent is not to erect a new Temple of Knowledge, but rather
                to place in the hands of the student a Master‑Key with which
                he may open the many inner doors in the Temple of Mystery
                through the main portals he has already entered.<br><br>
                There is no portion of the occult teachings possessed by the
                world which have been so closely guarded as the fragments
                of the Hermetic Teachings which have come down to us over
                the tens of centuries which have elapsed since the lifetime
                of its great founder, Hermes Trismegistus, the “scribe of the
                gods,” who dwelt in old Egypt in the days when the present
                race of men was in its infancy. Contemporary with Abraham,
                and, if the legends be true, an instructor of that venerable sage,
                Hermes was, and is, the Great Central Sun of Occultism, whose
                rays have served to illumine the countless teachings which
                have been promulgated since his time. All the fundamental and
                basic teachings embedded in the esoteric teachings of every
                race may be traced back to Hermes. Even the most ancient
                teachings of India undoubtedly have their roots in the original
                Hermetic Teachings.<br><br>
                From the land of the Ganges many advanced occultists
                wandered to the land of Egypt, and sat at the feet of the Master.
                From him they obtained the Master‑Key which explained
                and reconciled their divergent views, and thus the Secret
                Doctrine was firmly established. From other lands also came
                the learned ones, all of whom regarded Hermes as the Master
                of Masters, and his influence was so great that in spite of the
                many wanderings from the path on the part of the centuries
                of teachers in these different lands, there may still be found a
                certain basic resemblance and correspondence which underlies
                the many and often quite divergent theories entertained and
                taught by the occultists of these different lands today. The
                student of Comparative Religions will be able to perceive the
                influence of the Hermetic Teachings in every religion worthy
                of the name, now known to man, whether it be a dead religion
                or one in full vigor in our own times. There is always a certain
                correspondence in spite of the contradictory features, and the
                Hermetic Teachings act as the Great Reconciler.<br><br>
                The lifework of Hermes seems to have been in the direction of
                planting the great Seed‑Truth which has grown and blossomed
                in so many strange forms, rather than to establish a school of
                philosophy which would dominate the world’s thought. But,
                nevertheless, the original truths taught by him have been
                kept intact in their original purity by a few men in each age,
                who, refusing great numbers of half‑developed students and
                followers, followed the Hermetic custom and reserved their
                truth for the few who were ready to comprehend and master
                it. From lip to ear the truth has been handed down among the
                few. There have always been a few Initiates in each generation,
                in the various lands of the earth, who kept alive the sacred
                flame of the Hermetic Teachings, and such have always been
                willing to use their lamps to re‑light the lesser lamps of the
                outside world, when the light of truth grew dim, and clouded
                by reason of neglect, and when the wicks became clogged with
                foreign matter. There were always a few to tend faithfully the
                altar of the Truth, upon which was kept alight the Perpetual
                Lamp of Wisdom. These men devoted their lives to the labor of
                love which the poet has so well stated in his lines:<br><br>

                <div class="intro_poem">
                    <blockquote><strong><em>“O, let not the flame die out! Cherished age after age in its dark
                                cavern—in its holy temples cherished. Fed by pure ministers of love—
                                let not the flame die out!”</em></strong>
                    </blockquote>
                </div>

                <div class="introduction_chapter2">
                    These men have never sought popular approval, nor numbers
                    of followers. They are indifferent to these things, for they know
                    how few there are in each generation who are ready for the
                    truth, or who would recognize it if it were presented to them.
                    They reserve the “strong meat for men,” while others furnish the
                    “milk for babes.” They reserve their pearls of wisdom for the few
                    elect, who recognize their value and who wear them in their
                    crowns, instead of casting them before the materialistic vulgar
                    swine, who would trample them in the mud and mix them
                    with their disgusting mental food. But still these men have
                    never forgotten or overlooked the original teachings of Hermes,
                    regarding the passing on of the words of truth to those ready
                    to receive it, which teaching is stated in <em>The Kybalion</em> as follows:
                    “Where fall the footsteps of the Master, the ears of those ready
                    for his Teaching open wide.” And again: “When the ears of the
                    student are ready to hear, then cometh the lips to fill them with
                    wisdom.” But their customary attitude has always been strictly
                    in accordance with the other Hermetic aphorism, also in The
                    Kybalion: “The lips of Wisdom are closed, except to the ears of
                    Understanding.”<br><br>
                    There are those who have criticised this attitude of the
                    Hermetists, and who have claimed that they did not manifest
                    the proper spirit in their policy of seclusion and reticence. But
                    a moment’s glance back over the pages of history will show the
                    wisdom of the Masters, who knew the folly of attempting to
                    teach to the world that which it was neither ready or willing
                    to receive. The Hermetists have never sought to be martyrs,
                    and have, instead, sat silently aside with a pitying smile on their
                    closed lips, while the “heathen raged noisily about them” in
                    their customary amusement of putting to death and torture
                    the honest but misguided enthusiasts who imagined that they
                    could force upon a race of barbarians the truth capable of
                    being understood only by the elect who had advanced along
                    The Path.<br><br>
                    And the spirit of persecution has not as yet died out in the
                    land. There are certain Hermetic Teachings, which, if publicly
                    promulgated, would bring down upon the teachers a great cry
                    of scorn and revilement from the multitude, who would again
                    raise the cry of “Crucify! Crucify.”<br><br>
                    In this little work we have endeavored to give you an idea of
                    the fundamental teachings of <em>The Kybalion</em>, striving to give you
                    the working Principles, leaving you to apply them yourselves,
                    rather than attempting to work out the teaching in detail. If
                    you are a true student, you will be able to work out and apply
                    these Principles—if not, then you must develop yourself into
                    one, for otherwise the Hermetic Teachings will be as “words,
                    words, words” to you.

                    From old Egypt have come the fundamental esoteric and
                    occult teachings which have so strongly influenced the
                    philosophies of all races, nations and peoples, for several
                    thousand years. Egypt, the home of the Pyramids and the
                    Sphinx, was the birthplace of the Hidden Wisdom and Mystic
                    Teachings. From her Secret Doctrine all nations have borrowed.
                    India, Persia, Chaldea, Medea, China, Japan, Assyria, ancient
                    Greece and Rome, and other ancient countries partook liberally
                    at the feast of knowledge which the Hierophants and Masters of
                    the Land of Isis so freely provided for those who came prepared
                    to partake of the great store of Mystic and Occult Lore which
                    the masterminds of that ancient land had gathered together.<br><br>
                    In ancient Egypt dwelt the great Adepts and Masters who
                    have never been surpassed, and who seldom have been equaled,
                    during the centuries that have taken their processional flight
                    since the days of the Great Hermes. In Egypt was located the
                    Great Lodge of Lodges of the Mystics. At the doors of her
                    Temples entered the Neophytes who afterward, as Hierophants,
                    Adepts, and Masters, traveled to the four corners of the earth,
                    carrying with them the precious knowledge which they were
                    ready, anxious, and willing to pass on to those who were ready
                    to receive the same. All students of the Occult recognize the
                    debt that they owe to these venerable Masters of that ancient
                    land.<br><br>
                    But among these great Masters of Ancient Egypt there once
                    dwelt one of whom Masters hailed as “The Master of Masters.”
                    This man, if “man” indeed he was, dwelt in Egypt in the earliest
                    days. He was known as Hermes Trismegistus. He was the father
                    of the Occult Wisdom; the founder of Astrology; the discoverer
                    of Alchemy. The details of his life story are lost to history, owing
                    to the lapse of the years, though several of the ancient countries
                    disputed with each other in their claims to the honor of having
                    furnished his birthplace—and this thousands of years ago. The
                    date of his sojourn in Egypt, in that his last incarnation on this
                    planet, is not now known, but it has been fixed at the early
                    days of the oldest dynasties of Egypt—long before the days of
                    Moses. The best authorities regard him as a contemporary of
                    Abraham, and some of the Jewish traditions go so far as to claim
                    that Abraham acquired a portion of his mystic knowledge from
                    Hermes himself.<br><br>
                    As the years rolled by after his passing from this plane of
                    life (tradition recording that he lived three hundred years in
                    the flesh), the Egyptians deified Hermes, and made him one of
                    their gods, under the name of Thoth. Years after, the people of
                    Ancient Greece also made him one of their many gods—calling
                    him “Hermes, the god of Wisdom.” The Egyptians revered his
                    memory for many centuries—yes, tens of centuries—calling
                    him “the Scribe of the Gods,” and bestowing upon him,
                    distinctively, his ancient title, “Trismegistus,” which means “the
                    thrice‑great”; “the great‑great”; “the greatest‑great”; etc. In all
                    the ancient lands, the name of Hermes Trismegistus was revered,
                    the name being synonymous with the “Fount of Wisdom."<br><br>
                    Even to this day, we use the term “hermetic” in the sense of
                    “secret”; “sealed so that nothing can escape”; etc., and this by
                    reason of the fact that the followers of Hermes always observed
                    the principle of secrecy in their teachings. They did not believe
                    in “casting pearls before swine,” but rather held to the teaching
                    “milk for babes; meat for strong men,” both of which maxims
                    are familiar to readers of the Christian scriptures, but both of
                    which had been used by the Egyptians for centuries before the
                    Christian era/<br><br>
                    And this policy of careful dissemination of the truth has
                    always characterized the Hermetics, even unto the present day.
                    The Hermetic Teachings are to be found in all lands, among all
                    religions, but never identified with any particular country, nor
                    with any particular religious sect. This because of the warning
                    of the ancient teachers against allowing the Secret Doctrine to
                    become crystallized into a creed. The wisdom of this caution
                    is apparent to all students of history. The ancient occultism of
                    India and Persia degenerated, and was largely lost, owing to the
                    fact that the teachers became priests, and so mixed theology
                    with the philosophy, the result being that the occultism of India
                    and Persia has been gradually lost amidst the mass of religious
                    superstition, cults, creeds and “gods.” So it was with Ancient
                    Greece and Rome. So it was with the Hermetic Teachings of
                    the Gnostics and Early Christians, which were lost at the time
                    of Constantine, whose iron hand smothered philosophy with
                    the blanket of theology, losing to the Christian Church that
                    which was its very essence and spirit, and causing it to grope
                    throughout several centuries before it found the way back to its
                    ancient faith, the indications apparent to all careful observers in
                    this Twentieth Century being that the Church is now struggling
                    to get back to its ancient mystic teachings.<br><br>
                    But there were always a few faithful souls who kept alive the
                    Flame, tending it carefully, and not allowing its light to become
                    extinguished. And thanks to these staunch hearts, and fearless
                    minds, we have the truth still with us. But it is not found in
                    books, to any great extent. It has been passed along from
                    Master to Student; from Initiate to Hierophant; from lip to
                    ear. When it was written down at all, its meaning was veiled in
                    terms of alchemy and astrology, so that only those possessing
                    the key could read it aright. This was made necessary in order
                    to avoid the persecutions of the theologians of the Middle
                    Ages, who fought the Secret Doctrine with fire and sword; stake,
                    gibbet and cross. Even to this day there will be found but few
                    reliable books on the Hermetic Philosophy, although there are
                    countless references to it in many books written on various
                    phases of Occultism. And yet, the Hermetic Philosophy is the
                    only Master Key which will open all the doors of the Occult
                    Teachings!<br><br>
                    In the early days, there was a compilation of certain Basic
                    Hermetic Doctrines, passed on from teacher to student, which
                    was known as “The Kybalion,” the exact significance and
                    meaning of the term having been lost for several centuries. This
                    teaching, however, is known to many to whom it has descended,
                    from mouth to ear, on and on throughout the centuries. Its
                    precepts have never been written down, or printed, so far as we
                    know. It was merely a collection of maxims, axioms, and precepts,
                    which were non‑understandable to outsiders, but which were
                    readily understood by students, after the axioms, maxims, and
                    precepts had been explained and exemplified by the Hermetic
                    Initiates to their Neophytes. These teachings really constituted
                    the basic principles of “The Art of Hermetic Alchemy,” which,
                    contrary to the general belief, dealt in the mastery of Mental
                    Forces, rather than Material Elements—the Transmutation
                    of one kind of Mental Vibrations into others, instead of the
                    changing of one kind of metal into another. The legends of
                    the “Philosopher’s Stone” which would turn base metal into
                    Gold, was an allegory relating to Hermetic Philosophy, readily
                    understood by all students of true Hermeticism.<br><br>
                    In this little book, of which this is the First Lesson, we invite
                    our students to examine into the Hermetic Teachings, as set
                    forth in The Kybalion, and as explained by ourselves, humble
                    students of the Teachings, who, while bearing the title of
                    Initiates, are still students at the feet of Hermes, the Master. We
                    herein give you many of the maxims, axioms and precepts of
                    The Kybalion accompanied by explanations and illustrations
                    which we deem likely to render the teachings more easily
                    comprehended by the modern student, particularly as the
                    original text is purposely veiled in obscure terms.<br><br>
                    The original maxims, axioms, and precepts of “The Kybalion”
                    are printed herein, in quotation marks, the proper credit being
                    given. Our own work is printed in the regular way, in the body
                    of the work. We trust that the many students to whom we now
                    offer this little work will derive as much benefit from the study
                    of its pages as have the many who have gone on before, treading
                    the same Path to Mastery throughout the centuries that have
                    passed since the times of Hermes Trismegistus—the Master
                    of Masters—the Great‑Great. In the words of “The Kybalion”:
