            <p class="intro_to_centenary_page">People grazing in metaphysical bookshops may have wondered about the
                mysterious
                volume
                called <em>The Kybalion,</em> written by "Three Initiates"and first issued by the Yogi Publication
                Society
                of Chicago in 1908. The best-known edition is a plain volume bound in blue cloth and stamped with gold,
                in a format like those of other books from the same publisher, including various works on yoga by one
                Swami
                Ramacharaka.<br><br>
                <em>The Kybalion</em> claims to be a brief introduction to a mystical tradiion that has survived from
                antiquity.
                The core of the work is a series of aphorisms which, the authors contend, go back to the "early days"
                and
                were "passed
                on from teacher to student...the exact signification and meaning of the terms having been lost for
                several
                centuries."<br><br>
                The word <em>Kybalion,</em> taken at face value, looks vaguely Greek, but it hasno meaning in that
                language;
                the closest word to it in the standard Greek lexicon, curiously, is <em>kybeia,</em> meaning "dice
                game."
                It is also tempting to connect this word with the Jewish mystical tradition known as the Kabbalah,
                especially
                given that early modern occult texts (such as the seventeenth century English translation of Cornelius
                Agrippas's
                <em>Three Books of Occult Philosophy</em>) sometimes use a Hebrew word for Kabbalists:
                <em><small>mecubalim.</small></em> But the Kabbalah is never mentioned in <em>The Kybalion.</em>
                Rather it presents itself as the essence of the teaching of Hermes Trismegistus ("Thrice-Greatest
                Hermes"),
                a legendary, semidevine figure who is said to have brought learning to Egypt in the remotest past.
                Hermes Trismegistus is often identified with both the Greek god Hermes and the Egyption god
                Thoth.<br><br>
                <em>The Kybalion</em> is organised according to seven basic principles, which, it says, form the basis
                of
                occult philosophy:</p>

            <p class="intro_to_centenary_page2">
                The origins of this book have mystified many. Scholar Philippe Deslippe argues, convincingly, I believe,
                that it was written by
                <!--tag william walker--> William Walker Atkinson, who operated the
                Yogi Publication Society in Chicago (he is also thought to be "Swami Ramacharaka"). As the first
                principle -"Mentalism"- suggestes, the ideas of the <em>The Kybalion</em> bear some resembelance to
                <!--tag new thought--> New Thought, a movement to which Atkinson was closely connected.
                The Universe, <em>The Kybalion</em> tells us, is contained in "the Mind of <small>THE</small> All":
                "The All creates the universe <small>MENTALLY,</small> in a manner akin to the process whereby Man
                creates Mental Images." This ide is central to practically all New Thought teachings.<br><br>
                Nevertheless, the book does echo more remote past. The term
                <!--tag The All--> "The All," for example,
                resembles the Greek <em>t&ograve; p&acirc;n</em> which also means "the all" and which appears in some
                Hermetic maxims, most famously <em>H&egrave;n t&ograve; p&acirc;n:</em> "All is one."<br><br>
                Given the claims made for it, the most obvious source to examine for the roots of the <em>The
                    Kybalion</em> is the
                <!--tag corpus hermeticum--> <em>Corpus Hermeticum</em> or "Hermetic Body" of texts. These were
                composed probably in the early centuries <small>CE</small> and purport to expound the widom of Egypt as
                narrated
                in a series of discourses and dialogues including Hermes and his son
                <!--tag tat--> Tat (a version of "Thoth"). And indeed there intriguing resemblances between these works
                and <em>The Kybalion</em>. The first text in the <em>Corpus Hermeticum,</em> the
                <!--tag Poimandres--><em>Poimandres</em>
                (probably a Greek adaptation of the Egyptian <em>p-eime-n-re</em>, or, "mind of authority"), tells us
                that the source of the universe was no&ucirc;s-consciousness or Mind much as <em>The Kybalion</em>
                asserts the
                principle of "Mentalism." Moreover, this divine mind is described as "being androgyne and existing as
                light and life" - which parallels the concept of "Gender" as set out in <em>The Kybalion.</em><br><br>
                <em>The Kybalion</em> also speaks of the principle of correspondence. This idea appears in another
                ancient
                Hermetic text: the extremely brief and elliptical
                <!--tag emerald tablet--> <em>Emerald Tablet</em>, which says in Latin, <em>"Quod est superius
                    est sicut quod est inferius, et quod est inferius est sicut quod est superius, ad perpetranda
                    miracula rei unius":</em> "What is above is like what is below, and what is below is like what is
                above, to enact the wonders of
                the one thing."
                (The <em>Emerald Tablet</em> is said to have originally been written in
                <!--tag syriac--> Syriac,
                <!--tag semitic--> a Semitic language spoken
                in the eastern Mediterranean world in antiquity, but it survives only in somewhat dissimilar
                translations in Latin and Arabic.)<br><br>
                Whether there really was a collection of aphorisms know and <em>The Kybalion</em>and passed down
                from master to pupil from the days of antiquity is hard to say. There are, to my knowledge, no copies
                of it or any reference to it tat predate the
                <!--tag to 1908 edition--> 1908 edition, but that does
                not mean there were none. And there are claims of similarly hidden texts in other traditions.
                The Russian Esotericist
                <!--tag Boris Mouravieff--> Boris Mouravieff claimed that esoteric Christianity
                has an unpublished set of aphorisms called
                <!--tag The Golden Book--> <em>The Golden Book</em>, some
                of which he quotes in his three volume work <em>Gnosis: Study and Commentaries on the Esoteric Tradition
                    of Eastern Orthodoxy</em> (although these do not resemble the maxims of <em>The Kybalion</em> to any
                degree).<br><br>
                As for the author,
                <!--tag to william walker--> William Walker Atkinson (1862-1932) was born in
                Baltimore, Maryland. After an aborted career as a lawyer, he moved to Chicago with his family in 1900,
                and lived there for most of the rest of his life. He began writing books and articles in the vein of
                <!--tag to new though--> New Thought, a movement that stresses the power of the mind in creating
                reality. His first book,
                <!--tag to Thought Force--> <em>Thought Force,</em> was published in 1901.<br><br>
                Most of the Atkinson's were published pseudonymously. In 1908 he began writing under the name
                "Yogi Ramacharaka"and in 1908 <em>The Kybalion</em> appeared, ascribed to "Three Initiates."
                The publisher was Atkinson's own Chicago based <!--tag to yogi publication society--> Yogi Publication Society.<br><br>
                The indentity of these "Three Initiates" has long been a puzzle.
